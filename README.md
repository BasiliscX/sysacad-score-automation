# SSA (Sysacad Score Automation)

SSA is a Node.js API that automates fetching academic scores from the Sysacad system at the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional. It utilizes web scraping with Puppeteer to navigate the website, log in, extract student score information, and returns it in JSON format.

## Features

- **Task Automation**: Accesses the Sysacad system with provided credentials and extracts scores without manual intervention.
- **Security and Transparency**: No personal information is stored or stolen. You can review the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/BasiliscX/sysacad-score-automation.git) to verify its operation.
- **Web Interface**: Includes a simple web interface to interact with the API via an HTML form on the main screen or through tools like Insomnia and Postman.

## Usage

### Web Interface
